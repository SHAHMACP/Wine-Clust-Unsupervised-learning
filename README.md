# Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing wine quality using machine learning techniques, particularly clustering models. The goal is to group wines based on quality using the Elbow Method and DBSCAN clustering after applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The dataset contains physicochemical attributes and corresponding quality scores for different wines.

## Features
- Alcohol
- Malic Acid
- Ash
- Ash Alcanity
- Magnesium
- Total Phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid Phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color Intensity
- Hue
- OD280
- Proline


## Models Used
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Clustering:** Elbow Method, DBSCAN

## Evaluation Metrics
- Silhouette Score
- Davies-Bouldin Index
- Clustering Accuracy (if labeled data available)

## Results
The project evaluates clustering performance after reducing dimensionality using PCA. Results are visualized using scatter plots and cluster analysis metrics.
